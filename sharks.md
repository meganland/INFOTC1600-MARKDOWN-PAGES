# Shark
Sharks are boneless creatures. Instead, their skeletons are made of _cartilage_. Their skin also has a sand paper feel to it due to it being covered in tiny, tooth-like **scales**. Sharks are found in all the oceans around the world. Three types of sharks include:
1. bull shark
2. hammerhead shark
3. tiger shark
